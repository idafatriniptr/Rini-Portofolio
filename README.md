### üìÇ Analyst, SQL, and Dashboard

Project Link | Associated | Tools | Project Description 
---|---|---|---|---
üîß [Dashboard API Management](https://github.com/)| Project, via PT Tabel Data Informatika|Superset for Visualization|This API Management Dashboard was developed to monitor API performance and user activity. It displays information on request status (success or failed), the most active APIs and users, as well as the growth of users and API traffic over time. The data is sourced from daily transaction logs, processed, and visualized to help the team monitor the system and make technical decisions more efficiently. All data in this project has been simulated to protect client confidentiality.
üíπ [Analisis dan Visualisasi Dashboard Keuangan](https://github.com)|Project, via PT Tabel Data Informatika| Python, DBeaver, Superset for Visualization| This dashboard was built for financial monitoring based on data processed and cleaned using Python. The workflow included data transformation, table mapping, and warehouse insertion. SQL validation in DBeaver was used to ensure accurate filtering, such as viewing balances by bank or separating income and expenses before visualization.
üñ•Ô∏è [Analisis dan Visualisasi Dashboard Testing Management](https://github.com/)|Project, via PT Tabel Data Informatika |Python, DBeaver, Superset for Visualization| This project involved building a Testing Management dashboard to monitor test results and bug fixing progress. I used Python to analyze API responses (success or failed) and validated the data using SQL via DBeaver. I also developed APIs/endpoints to connect the database to the application. The dashboard displays test statuses such as In Progress, Completed, and others, serving as a real-time monitoring tool for testing and fixing.
